Scripts and protocols for charging free energies correction project

Write a mdanalysis script that:
1) loads a topology and trajectory of a molecule of aspirin solvated in a box
2) for each frame in the dcd, select all non water molecules, write a pqr file. 

May need some more advanced scripting to include customise radii. see
